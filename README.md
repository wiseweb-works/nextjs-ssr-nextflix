**Next.js SSR Nextflix** is a dynamic and responsive web application designed to mimic a **Netflix**-like experience. The project leverages **Next.js 15** for server-side rendering (SSR), ensuring fast page loads and great SEO performance. **Firebase** is used for backend services such as authentication and real-time data. Additionally, **TailwindCSS** is employed for building a clean and responsive UI.

### Features

- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**: Built with **Next.js 15** for enhanced SEO and performance.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed with **TailwindCSS** for a mobile-first, flexible layout.
- **Authentication**: **Firebase** integration for user authentication.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches data using **Firebase**'s real-time database.
- **Toast Notifications**: Integrated **React Toastify** for user-friendly notifications.
